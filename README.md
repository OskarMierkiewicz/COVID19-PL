Analysis of the Pandemic (COVID19) situation in Poland from 03.03.20 to 30.04.21 (Polish language).<br>
It's my postgrduated thesis, which I had a plesaure creating with <b>Grzegorz Gumi≈Ñski</b>. 
We used a xlsx formats od data because csvs files did not work.<br>
Data downloaded straight from Polish Ministry of Health website https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/wykaz-zarazen-koronawirusem-sars-cov-2<br>
The zip called '<b>Dane</b>' means data files which you need to import in order to run the code. <br>
Please contact with me when you want to see an english version of that thesis, I may prepare for you english version.
